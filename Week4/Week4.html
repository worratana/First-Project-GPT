            <h2>iOS 26</h2>
            <p>iOS 26 is the latest major release of Apple's operating system for iPhones, 
                unveiled at WWDC 2025. It marks a significant shift in Apple's naming convention, 
                now reflecting the fiscal year (2026) rather than sequential numbering 
                (it's the successor to iOS 18, skipping what would have been iOS 19).</p>

            <h2>macOS 26</h2>
            <p>macOS 26, code-named "Tahoe," is the latest iteration of Apple's desktop operating system, 
                announced at WWDC 2025. Similar to iOS 26, it adopts the new year-based naming convention, 
                reflecting the 2025-2026 release cycle. This release brings a significant visual overhaul, 
                tighter integration with other Apple devices, and enhanced productivity features, 
                especially through a revamped Spotlight and Apple Intelligence.</p>

                transforming the tablet experience with a renewed focus on Mac-like multitasking, 
                a stunning new design, and the integration of Apple Intelligence. 
                It follows the new year-based naming convention,
